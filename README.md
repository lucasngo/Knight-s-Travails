# Knight-s-Travails
1.	INTRODUCTION:
a.	Problem:
-	Given a standard 8x8 chessboard, write Python code that accepts two squares identified by algebraic chess notation. The first square is the starting position, and the second square is the ending position. Find the shortest sequence of valid moves to take a Knight piece from the starting position to the ending position. Each move must be a legal move by a Knight. The output should be the number of steps needed to get a knight from starting point to end point and all the point the knight stop along the way.
-	If we expand the problem, we can develop a code where we can set the size of a chess map and set the possible way of moving and still we can find a way of moving to get to the target with the minimum distance traveled.
b.	Based knowledge to solve the problem:
-	The standard chess size is 8x8
-	The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally.
-	At one position in chess map, a knight has at most 8 possible moves
-	Given a random starting point, the knight can go to any position in the chess map.
